                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a student at BYU-I studying software engineering. I hope to work in development as a qulaity assurance engineer.
                    I am from Houston, TX but have loved living here in Idaho. I enjoy problem solving and critical thinking games. In my free time I like to 
                    do arts and crafts. I am working on making matching sweaters for everyone in my family. </p>

                <p>For the first half of the semester we worked on creating a home page for White Water Rafting.
                    In this project we learned how to structure our html to make a webpage. We then worked on 
                    adding the css to make it appealing. We got to explore many different techniques.</p>

                <h2>ICE</h2>
                <p>Throughout the semester we worked on exercises in class. We were given a challenge or prompt 
                    of some sort to complete. Being in class gave us the opportunity to work with other classmates 
                    or ask the teacher for help if we got stuck. During the first ice challenge I felt completely 
                    lost, but as we did more I gained confidence. I began looking forward to the next challenges.</p>
